# earnings_announcements_ML
This project focuses on the task of using advanced machine learning techniques to forecast abnormal returns after earnings announcements for SP500 Index. Earnings releases are market events that can lead to significant price movement, and accurately predicting the direction and extent of these reactions can provide a competitive edge to market participants.
I constructed a modeling pipeline that applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection and performance evaluation. The goal is to test whether historical patterns and engineered signals can lead to meaningful predictions in a trading context.
