# earnings_announcements_ML
This project focuses on the task of using advanced machine learning techniques to forecast abnormal returns after earnings announcements for the SP500 Index. Earnings releases are market events that can lead to significant price movement, and accurately predicting the direction and extent of these reactions can provide a competitive edge to market participants.
I constructed a modelling pipeline that applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection and performance evaluation. The goal is to test whether historical patterns and engineered signals can lead to meaningful predictions in a trading context.

The problem was around performing high-quality feature engineering that can look at a complex dataset of static features, such as earnings announcements(X_train) on the day, as well as looking at the dynamic features - stock prices from all_prices, and constructing extra ones using momentum.   
30-day lookback panel, built from the enriched all_prices and X_train, was incorporated to capture historical patterns. Combining these two features, static and dynamic, has produced complex 3-D models that were then fed into different ML models and were evaluated. The main prediction task addressed was to estimate the forward return of a stock after its earnings release. Implemented several modelling techniques, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Lasso Regression. Each of these models was trained on the in-sample part of the data and was subject to hyperparameter tuning where applicable.

Furthermore, the model results have been backtested against simple benchmarks of always long and short strategies on financial release day, which simulates the 50% benchmark(random guessing). 

The figure below shows the evaluation metrics results from the models, combining all the fold models and assembling the final one by testing on the final test set. It is obvious that, while the results are not significant and markets are mostly efficient, it is possible to enter the market and capture the momentum 5-10 days before the announcement and capture insider trading on some occasions. Overall, XGBoost is considered the best-performing model.
